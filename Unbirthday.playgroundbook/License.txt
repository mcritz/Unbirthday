The Apple Software upgrades and updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Apple releases for newer or other models of iOS devices.

2.  Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A.  License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and use a reasonable number of copies of the Apple Software on your compatible Apple-branded iOS devices that you own or control during the term of this License for testing and evaluation purposes only.  The Apple Software is not licensed for use in a commercial operating environment where it may be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a final-release commercial-grade product and should not be used with data that is not sufficiently and regularly backed up.  You may not distribute or make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. 

B.  Swift Playgrounds App.  The Apple Software licensed hereunder is the Swift Playgrounds App (“Playgrounds App”), which contains or otherwise includes documents referred to as “Playgrounds”.  The Playgrounds App provides reusable content such as graphics, artwork, images, photographs, sounds and similar content (collectively, the “Playgrounds Content”), and reusable computer code, for use in creating your own documents within the Playgrounds App in accordance with this License. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, during the term of this License and conditioned upon your compliance with these terms, you may: (i) use the templates provided in the Playgrounds App to create documents within the Playgrounds App; (ii) use and modify the Playgrounds Content in the documents you create using the Playgrounds App; and (iii) use the computer code provided in the templates in “Starting Points” and/or in the “Learn to Code”, “Challenges”, or “Accessories” tabs to create documents within the Playgrounds App, unless any such computer code is accompanied by another license, in which case, that license applies to the use and distribution of such computer code.   Any computer code provided within the Playgrounds App that enables access to or interacts with an Apple application programming interface may be used only within documents running within the Playgrounds App on an Apple-branded device and may not be copied, reverse engineered or used on any other platform. 

You acknowledge that no framework will be made available in the Playgrounds App for creating applications for use outside the Playgrounds App.  You further acknowledge that in order to create any application for use outside the Playgrounds App on an Apple device running iOS, and/or for distribution via Apple’s App Store, you will need to enter into Apple’s Developer Program License Agreement.  For further information, please refer to information about the Apple Developer Program at https://developer.apple.com.

The computer code provided for use in creating documents in the Playgrounds App may not be used in any applications running outside of the Playgrounds App other than when editing such documents using Xcode, unless such computer code is accompanied by another license, in which case that license applies to the use and distribution of such computer code.
