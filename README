# Unbirhday for iPad Playgrounds

## What it does

Unbirthday is an iPad playground. You’ll need an iPad with the Swift Playgrounds app installed.

Unbirthday finds milestones and palindromes in days of your birthday.

Milestones are round numbers like “50,000 days old”. Palindromes are reflected numbers like “32123 days old”.

## How to get it

Use a Mac and airdrop the Playground over. Or use a git client on iPad. I like Working Copy.
